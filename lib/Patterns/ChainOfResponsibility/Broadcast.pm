=head1 NAME
 
Patterns::ChainOfResponsibility::Broadcast - The Broadcast Dispatch Strategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dispatch @args to each Handler in turn until we have processed each handler
Use this when you want to pass the same args to a bunch of handlers and don't
care about what happens to them.  A possible example would be a bunch of 
loggers that log events differently but independently.

You won't use this class directly.
Please see L<Patterns::ChainOfResponsibility::Role::Handler>
